# NoSQL Social Network API

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description
This application is an API which can be used by a social network web application to allow users to create a friend list, share their thoughts, and react to their friends thoughts. This app would be perfect for any social media company. It uses a NoSQL database, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database, [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) for routing, and [Mongoose ODM](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html) to handle large amount of unstructured data.

[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download) is used for testing routes and viewing the output of the routes. GET routes for users and thoughts are used to show data that is displayed in JSON format. POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are used in order to create, update, and delete users, thoughts, friends, and reactions in the database.
